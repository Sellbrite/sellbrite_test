Congratulations on making it this far into the Sellbrite developer interview process.  Thanks for taking the time to do this test project.  Itâ€™s aim is to demonstrate basic familiarity with Rails and ability to implement a new feature by making changes to (or adding) existing models and modifying the UI accordingly.

Clone the test repository here: https://github.com/Sellbrite/sellbrite_test

Run `rake db:migrate`

There is just one model created using Rails scaffold generator.  The Product model contains just a few fields: sku, name, description, price.

Start your server `rails server` and hit `http://localhost:3000/products` and add a few dummy products.

Our fields for the product model are quite limited.  Different types of products have wildly different properties to keep track of.  For example electronic toys might need a field to keep track of whether or not a battery is included.  Or cameras might need a field to keep track of the screen size.  

We would like the ability to persist additional custom fields to different types of products, such as "Includes Battery" => "Yes", or "Screen Diagonal" => "7in".  In otherwords, implement a new feature that will allow us to associate arbitrary key/value pairs of data for a product during data entry.  

There are multiple ways to architect this and there is no one "correct" way.  We'd like to see how you would approach a design that fulfills the following requirements:

1) On the product edit page I should be able to add new custom fields.  For example I could have two text fields: one for key in which I input "Country of Origin" and the other text field for value which I input "China" and a submit button to persist it.

2) I should be able to view a product and see the list of custom fields I have added on it.  

3) I should be able to remove or change the value of a custom field on a product.

4) I should not be able to add the same key twice.  For example a product should not be able to have two custom fields that are both named "Country of Origin"

5) When adding custom fields to a product, in the UI I would like to see a drop-down list for any previously created custom field keys.  For example if I edit product 'A' and add a new custom field for "Country of Origin" and save it, when I go to edit product 'B' I should be able to select "Country of Origin" from a dropdown instead of having to try to type out or try to remember which keys I have already used before.  

You may make any changes to the UI or the models to make this possible.  This is an exercise in how you think.

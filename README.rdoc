Congratulations on making it this far into the Sellbrite developer interview process.  Thanks for taking the time to do this test project.  Itâ€™s aim is to demonstrate basic familiarity with Rails and ability to display model information with a simple UI.

Clone the test repository here: https://github.com/Sellbrite/sellbrite_test

There is just one model created using Rails scaffold generator.  The Product model contains just a few fields: sku, name, description, price.

We would like the ability to add additional custom data to a product, such as "Includes Battery" => "Yes", or "Screen Diagonal" => "7in".  There are multiple ways to achieve this and there is no one right answer.  Using any test framework of your choice, demonstrate the following use cases by writing tests to flush out the implementation.

1) Custom data can be added to a product and persisted.  I should be able to store and retrieve abitrary custom strings for any product.

#for example, and you don't need to use this api
product.add_custom_field("color", "green")
product.get_custom_field("color") => "green"

2) I should be able to rename a custom label, e.g. change "Includes Battery" to "Battery Included" across all products.  This operation should be efficient across thousands of products.

#for example
product.get_custom_field("Includes Battery") => "Yes"
Product.rename_custom_field("Includes Battery", "Battery Included")
product.get_custom_field("Battery Included") => "Yes"

3) I should be able to list all the custom fields I've added across all products.  Again this should be an efficient operation across thousands of products.

#for example
product.add_custom_field("color", "green")
product2.add_custom_field("size", "blue")
Product.custom_labels => ["color", "size"]

4) I should be able to know which products are missing custom fields

#find all products that do not have custom field 'color'
